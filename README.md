# WX-station-LoRa-WiFi
An APRS LoRa weather station with a TTGO module.

I found the original idea written by DJ7OO : http://www.kh-gps.de/LoRa_WX.htm
I adapted it with new libraries, added a configuration file, better routines, etc...

The minimal version uses a BME280 sensor that measures pressure, humidity, temperature which is connected to a TTGO T3 v1.6.1 module.
A rain sensor, a wind vane and a anemometer can be added to make a complete station.
